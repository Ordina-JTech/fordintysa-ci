# Fordintys-CI

This repository contains everything you need for the workshop Continuous Integration, developed by Ordina JTech for Fontys Hogeschool.

Using Docker we'll spin up a preconfigured build server on your own computer, containing GitLab, Jenkins with Maven and Artifactory.

The Java software we're going to build is also contained in this repository. You can use your favorite IDE and Git client, or edit directly the source code in GitLab. More on that later.

## Prerequisites

  * Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit)
  * or Mac OS/X
  * about 20 GB free disk space

If you use a 32-bits version of Windows, you can try a manual install of the components making up Docker-Machine, but this is not supported.

Linux users might get it running, with limited support by us.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Docker-Machine

### 2. Run the Docker QuickStart terminal

### 3. Start the magic script

## Known Problems

Where shall we start...
