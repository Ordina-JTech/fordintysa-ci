The first requirement for practicing [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) is using a version control system for the project's source code, aka **SCM**, which stands for _Source Code/Control Management_.

By far the most popular SCM is [Git](https://git-scm.com/). You probably have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your PC, often integrated with your IDE. If not, now is a good time!

Having a local repository is already a step forwards, but if you're working in a team on the same code base, it makes sense to connect it to a server.

[GitBlit](http://gitblit.com/) is a basic repository management tool for hosting git repositories. It's a bit like GitHub used to be ten years ago. 

While GitHub has extended it's features with an integrated wiki, issue tracking system, online code editing etc, Gitblit concentrates on one thing: serving your central repositories.

So let's give it a spin!
